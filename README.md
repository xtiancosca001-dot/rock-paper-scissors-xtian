# Christian's Rock Paper Scissors
- This is my first project applying what I have learned so far about
problem solving, which is more important than the coding itself. 
- **Disclaimer**: The first version of this project doesn't have a UI yet.
The UI part will be later implemented after the logic is finished for
this one.
- All interactions will only be done through:
  1. Prompts for user inputs
  2. Console for the game itself (CLI - Just like DOS of the very old 
  days)

# NOTICE 07/15/2025
- **UPDATED**: The game already has a working UI and enjoy the rest of the
experience by challenging with the CPU. The said application is modern
and ready for playing.
